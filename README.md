# Dialrhea - revolutionary shitty machine
Dialrhea is a device made from old rotary phone. It acts as a Bluetooth LE keyboard, can be paired with compatible devices and control them. Three unique modes of operation offer endless possibilities.

## Modes of operation
Dialrhea supports three distinct modes of operation: 

* Gaming - in this mode the device acts as a game controller, it is configured to work with "Doom" games (using Doomsday Engine) out of the box
* Emoji - this mode is best used with mobile phones and allows you to type emoji's and send them to your friends
* Boring - in this mode Dialrhea just outputs the dialed numbers (not recommended)

## Disclamer
The device was made during a weekend in hackathon called Internet of Shit so expect the code to be pretty shitty.
